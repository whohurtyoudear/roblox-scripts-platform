## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Roblox Scripts Platform seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we've had a chance to address it.
2. **Submit a report** by creating an issue labeled "Security Issue" that includes:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Suggestions for addressing the issue (if available)

## What to Expect

When you submit a security issue:

- We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- We'll provide a timeline for addressing the issue
- We'll keep you updated as the vulnerability is addressed
- We'll recognize your contribution (if desired) after the issue is resolved

## Security Best Practices

The Roblox Scripts Platform has implemented several security measures:

- GDPR-compliant design with explicit cookie consent
- Secure password hashing using scrypt
- Session-based authentication with secure cookies
- Input validation on all forms and API endpoints
- Role-based access control for administrative functions
- Secure database connections

## Security Updates
